// Example 2: Variables, `var` vs `val`, and default initialization

// `var` can be reassigned; `val` is immutable.
var a = 10
val b = "MinJ"    // b cannot be reassigned

print "a = " + a
print "b = " + b

// Reassigning `a` works:
a = 20
print "a now = " + a

// Uncommenting the next line should error: cannot reassign `val`
// b = "oops"
